In my project, I created a web application using ReactJS that plots graphs based on user-inputted x-axis and y-axis data. Users can navigate to a graph page from the home page. On the graph page, they can enter comma-separated values for the x and y axes. After submitting the data, the application generates a plot using Plotly.js.
